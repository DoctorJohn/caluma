## 2. Implementation

In this chapter, we'll create and execute the example "exam" workflow which has been introduced in the [previous chapter, "Workflow Concepts"](workflow-concepts.md). We'll do so by executing mutations on the Caluma GraphQL API - to get most out of this guide, we recommend to follow along using the interactive GraphiQL console of your local Caluma installation (see the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/projectcaluma/caluma#getting-started) for installation instructions).
